CSVs of the Research Organization Registry

This repository contains CSV files of [Research Organization Registry data](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-data). These CSVs are **not officially supported by ROR** and may contain errors or may lack data contained in the official ROR data files. CSV files of ROR's JSON data can be generated by importing ROR's JSON data into [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org) and then exporting the data as CSV. 

ROR publishes data files in JSON on Zenodo at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7644942](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7644942).
