CSVs of the Research Organization Registry

This repository contains CSV files of [Research Organization Registry data](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-data). These CSVs are **not officially supported by ROR** and may contain errors or may lack data contained in the official ROR data files. These files were generated by importing ROR's JSON data into OpenRefine and then exporting the data as CSV.
